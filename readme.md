# Chatbots Definition

**What are chatbots?**
Chatbots are programme that is used to converse with users. 
At first, it was rule-based but today, we can see LLM-based chatbots that break up the limit of rule-based chatbots.
For example, rule-based chatbots were unable to reply to the unexpected questions, but LLM can do that.

**What chatbots can do**
LLM-powered chatbots can help companies to deal with customer survices, be a companion for people etc.
There are many kinds of charbots - Customer Support Chatbots, Conversational/Companion Chatbots, Educational Chatbots, Productivity & Utility Chatbots and so on.
I will focus on the **Conversational/Companion Chatbots, however, it should be applied to general chatbots.

## Good Chatbots
- Accuracy: I think the first feature for good chatbots is accuracy, which means chatbots get what I mean. 
- Showing Emotions: Thoough it understands what I mean, it should show emotions to make the conversation feel engaging and joyable.
- 24/7 Availability: Chatbots are always approachable whereas humans cannot always reply to us. 
- Customization: We can direct chatbots to respond in a way we want to. As we talk more, they know more about us, and adapt to us more.

## Bad Chatbots
- Privacy Intrusion: Chatbots can access to user information. Especially, conversational chatbots and users talk about private things, so it if use the data for the model, it can manipulate people. 
- Dependancy: Conversational chatbots can replace human relationships and social activity. It should not replace human interaction but just assist human communication.
- Harming People: Conversational chatbots may reflect our biased and harmful words, so it should not make people to do harmful things such as suicide or homicide.

## Ethical Aspects that draws a line between good and bad chatbots. ##

![Chatbot Suicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MQZv5h_lFU)
Chatbots can harm people. Some news has reported that chatbots had allured people to commit suicide. 
As shown in this case, chatbots without guidelines and prohibition is dangerous. 
Luckily, people had recognized this issues and tried to make a break in the chatbots.
However, I think there is more subtle problems left in the chatbots.
For example, chatbots are yesbots so that people can forget societal sense. 
Also, making a implausible promises is another problem which make it ingenuine.
